Setup and settings
==================

There are moments when you are setting up a new machine elsewhere or want to help out a friend and when you know that you have it working on your… oh wait… yes, on your *other* machine that you can't reach at the moment. To avoid this - or at least to ease the pain - I created this repo with a small collection of settings and setup instructions. It's meant to be for my own purposes, but feel free to have a look and feel inspired or so…

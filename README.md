# Setup and settings

There are moments when you are setting up a new machine elsewhere or want to help out a friend and when you know that you have it working on your… oh wait… yes, on your _other_ machine that you can't reach at the moment. To avoid this - _or at least to ease the pain_ - I created this repo with a small collection of settings and setup instructions. It's meant to be for my own purposes, but feel free to have a look and feel inspired or so…

## Application settings

The repo holds a folder ['Settings'](Settings) that contains - _wait for it_ - settings! They are for:

- [GitHub](Settings/GitHub/)
  - user-based gitconfig
  - global gitignore
  - template for a commit message
- [RubyGems](Settings/Ruby/)
  - settings for default gem installation
- [Sublime Text](Settings/Sublime%20Text/)
  - package settings
  - user settings
- [ZSH](Settings/ZSH/)
  - zshrc file with aliases, plugins and shell variables
